# Hypnotize
Console hipnosis :smile:

This is an implementation of a [CodeFights problem] (https://codefights.com/arcade/code-arcade/waterfall-of-integration/LfP67YRDw2rxoLmeP).
Even contours turn clockwise, odds - counter-clockwise. So it looks like an illusion spiral.
Need to color up all contours to black & white :confused:
